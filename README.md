## GOALS

## DESIGN

I wanted big bold headings and a gentle call to action. Montserrat font made a perfect heading that went well with the brand colors. I implemented a slight fade up effect to draw the customer into the content. 
To showcase the client's photos I combined a slider and a jQuery lightbox.  when the header dropdown triggers.
